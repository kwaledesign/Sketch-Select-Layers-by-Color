# Select Layers by Color (Sketch Plugin)

Forked from the [original select layers plugin](https://github.com/getflourish/Sketch-Select-Layers-by-Color), this plugin selects all layers that have the same fill color as the currently selected layer/s (command shift c), *but only on the currently active artboard*.
